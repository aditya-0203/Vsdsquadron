## Task 1: Writing a C Code to Compute the Sum of Numbers from 1 to n
---
### Step 1: Creating and Opening a New C File
  : To begin, I opened the terminal and executed commands to create and open a new C file using vim. This set up the environment to start coding.

### Step 2: Writing the Code
  : Once the file was opened in Vim, I wrote the C code to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. The logic was implemented and saved as shown below.

### Step 3: Compiling and Running the Code
  o After completing the code, I compiled it in the terminal to ensure there were no errors. I then ran the program to verify its functionality. The output matched the expected results, confirming the correctness of the code.

### Step 4: Testing with Different Values of n
  o To further validate the program, I tested it with various values of n, such as 50. Each time, the program produced the correct results, demonstrating its reliability.

# Running the code sum1ToN.c in RiscV simulator 
---

  ## 1] Before simulating the code we have compile it so use the following command

      o riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ToN.o sum1ToN.c

  ## 2] To simulate use below command -->  to obtain the assembly code for the above C program. 
      
     o riscv-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o
--- 
  ## 3] now we have to locate to main section 
   o /main

 ## 4] Observations in Assembly Instructions
          o The byte address for main was found to be 10184.
          o There were 15 instructions (in hexadecimal: E) when compiled with the -O1 optimization level.
          o The address of each consecutive instruction increments by 4 bytes, as observed in the disassembled output.

## 5]The same commands were run with the -Ofast optimization level instead of -O1. This resulted in a reduced number of instructionsâ€”12 instructions.

     o This demonstrates that the number and type of assembly instructions generated depend on the compilation optimization level used.
     o The higher optimization (-Ofast) produces a more compact and efficient assembly.
