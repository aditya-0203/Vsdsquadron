## Task 1: Writing a C Code to Compute the Sum of Numbers from 1 to n
---
### Step 1: Creating and Opening a New C File
  : To begin, I opened the terminal and executed commands to create and open a new C file using vim. This set up the environment to start coding.

### Step 2: Writing the Code
  : Once the file was opened in Vim, I wrote the C code to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. The logic was implemented and saved as shown below.

### Step 3: Compiling and Running the Code
  o After completing the code, I compiled it in the terminal to ensure there were no errors. I then ran the program to verify its functionality. The output matched the expected results, confirming the correctness of the code.

### Step 4: Testing with Different Values of n
  o To further validate the program, I tested it with various values of n, such as 50. Each time, the program produced the correct results, demonstrating its reliability.

# Running the code sum1ToN.c in RiscV simulator 
---

  ## 1] Before simulating the code we have compile it so use the following command

      o riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ToN.o sum1ToN.c
    
  ![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc5508ad-fb35-44c8-9527-6ac5502009e2)

---
  ## 2] To simulate use below command -->  to obtain the assembly code for the above C program. 
      
     o riscv-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o
--- 
  ## 3] now we have to locate to main section 
   o /main

  ![main](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0f16fec-6cfe-4613-ba53-931bb9e7f9e3)

 ## 4] Observations in Assembly Instructions
          o The byte address for main was found to be 10184.
          o There were 15 instructions (in hexadecimal: E) when compiled with the -O1 optimization level.
          o The address of each consecutive instruction increments by 4 bytes, as observed in the disassembled output.

   ![14_E_instruction](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60463680-06e0-4d72-9be3-e4179786cf1b)

## 5]The same commands were run with the -Ofast optimization level instead of -O1. This resulted in a reduced number of instructionsâ€”12 instructions.

     o This demonstrates that the number and type of assembly instructions generated depend on the compilation optimization level used.
     o The higher optimization (-Ofast) produces a more compact and efficient assembly.

# what is RISC-V

  It is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles.

  Base Instruction Formats

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c7d53f2-c2fc-47f4-aad3-1f2467df30d3)



  R-type Instructions

    Used for register-register operations, such as addition, subtraction, and bitwise logic operations.

    o rs2 (24-20): The second source register.
    o rs1 (19-15): The first source register.  
    o funct3 (14-12): Specifies the type of operation (e.g., add, sub, OR).
    o rd (11-7): The Rd register is also called the destination register, and the destination register is the register used to store the result
    o opcode (6-0): Identifies the operation class (e.g., arithmetic, logic).


  I-type Instructions

    Used for immediate data manipulation, load instructions, and other operations involving immediate values.

    o imm[4:0] (11-7): Lower 5 bits of the 12-bit immediate value.
    o opcode (6-0): Operation class identifier.

    o rs2 (24-20): Second source register.
    o rs1 (19-15): First source register.
    o funct3 (14-12): Specifies the branch condition (e.g., equal, not equal).
