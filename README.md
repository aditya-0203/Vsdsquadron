## Task 1: Writing a C Code to Compute the Sum of Numbers from 1 to n
---
### Step 1: Creating and Opening a New C File
  : To begin, I opened the terminal and executed commands to create and open a new C file using vim. This set up the environment to start coding.

### Step 2: Writing the Code
  : Once the file was opened in Vim, I wrote the C code to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. The logic was implemented and saved as shown below.

### Step 3: Compiling and Running the Code
  : After completing the code, I compiled it in the terminal to ensure there were no errors. I then ran the program to verify its functionality. The output matched the expected results, confirming the correctness of the code.

### Step 4: Testing with Different Values of n
  : To further validate the program, I tested it with various values of n, such as 50. Each time, the program produced the correct results, demonstrating its reliability.
